        <p> Hello, my name is Grace Virginia. I am currently a sophomore double majoring in computer science and film. <br>
            My interests include, movies, animals, makeup, music, and I enjoy spending my time with my boyfriend, friends, and family. <br>
            In high school, I studied Multimedia Communications where I learned photography, video, as well as graphic design <br>
            and how to advertise and work for clients. I was a member of the yearbook club and loved helping take photos.
