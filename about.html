      <h1> About Grace </h1>
        
        <p> This is my portfolio that I am creating for CSC 106 at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/"> University of Rhode Island. </a> <br>
      We are using Github to create this portfolio as we are learning the basics of HTML and programming. </p>
